# AngularJS App that uses Geolocation to show local weather.

Geoweather is built using html CSS and angularjs which, when you open the site, asks for a permission to read your current location, and then uses the http://openweathermap.org/current public API to fetch the weather for that location and displays it. If the user denies to share the location, it shows a little input form for entering either country name or zip code and displays the weather based on that location.
